## The Ultimate Cookbook

As a web development team, we would likely be asked to create a web application from scratch with responsive design. Being a developer we need to work in a team collaboratively, managing effectively the version control of the application that is going to be deployed. That is why we formed a team and worked for this project called 'THE ULTIMATE COOKBOOK'.


## Plan for the go!

First, we thought of using a CSS framework other than Bootstrap to work with our project. We have used third party APIs for developing our application, here are some insights!

* We have chosen Semantic-UI, the CSS framework

* We have used the third party APIs for 'https://themealdb.com/' website and are as follows:
      https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php
      https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?a=
      https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=
      https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?a=


### Salient features of this project

* The Semantic-UI minimizes the use of media queries.

* Use of Semantic-UI's grid system for rows, and columns.

* It is functional and a deployed application on GitHub having the repository with README describing the details of the project.
